  We have made Glider Forecast to have the first proper weather forecast service specifically tailored to the needs and interests mainly of paraglider pilots and other pilots of unpowered flight.

  We are paraglider pilots and we have been using this site over the last year while working on it, and we like it a lot. A lot of programming hours went into this project, and there are still many features to develop. Please check it out, use it, and let us know what you think, and how you think we can make it even better.
