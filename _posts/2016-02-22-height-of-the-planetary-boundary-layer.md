Check out our new map for the Height of the Planetary Boundary Layer!

The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is the lowest part of the atmosphere. Its behavior is directly influenced by its contact with a ground.

This is a mixed layer produced by surface friction, terrain, speed and directional wind sheer, but also by convection.

Thus the height of this layer can be an indicator of the maximum thermalling height.
